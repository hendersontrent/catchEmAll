# catchEmAll <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="120" />

CAnonical Time-series CHaracteristics for multiple domains - an efficient implementation for `R` written as a package to calculate time series features from [catch22](https://github.com/chlubba/catch22), [catchaMouse16](https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/catchaMouse16), and other reduced-redundancy feature sets.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
comment = NA, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8, cache = FALSE)
```

## Installation

*Coming to CRAN soon... Stay posted!*

You can also install the development version of `catchEmAll` from GitHub using the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/catchEmAll")
```

## Motivation

The highly comparative time-series analysis approach to temporal data is a data-driven and largely field agnostic one. Pioneered largely through [Ben Fulcher's](http://www.benfulcher.com) `MATLAB` toolbox [`hctsa`](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa) and various associated feature-based time-series analysis publications (such as [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08055) and [this paper](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2013.0048)), this approach has proven effective in detecting signal from noise, classifying groups, and performing regression tasks. These performance gains likely occur for several reasons:

* **Feature space is much more computationally efficient than measurement space** - enabling a more diverse range of algorithms and statistical models to be fit to its outputs
* **Feature space can reveal dynamical and nonlinear relationships between statistical processes that the measurement space may not be able to detect** - enabling a deeper and potentially more sophisticated understanding of the empirical structure and similarity between time series
* **Dimension reduction techniques generalise well to the feature space** - enabling methods such as Principal Components Analysis and t-SNE to reveal patterns across groups of features, and promote effective data visualisation

Since `MATLAB` is proprietary software, a major barrier to broader adoption of this philosophy of highly comparative methods is one largely of the available tools. This package, `catchEmAll`, aims to bridge some of this gap by providing convenience functions for the user that automatically calculate different sets of features on any input time series using the free open-source language [`R`](https://www.r-project.org). Most (if not all) of the features that are available in `catchEmAll` exist within the larger >7,700 feature set that comprises `hctsa`.

## Available functions

There are three core time-series functions in `catchEmAll` so far (where `x` is a numerical time-series input vector):

1. `catch22_all(x)`
2. `catchaMouse16_all(x)`
3. `catch_all(x)`

The first two functions `catch22_all()` and `catchaMouse16_all()` automatically calculate individual summary statistics for each of the time-series features included in their respective sets. If you want to run all feature calculations in both sets at once, you can use the third function `catch_all()` to achieve this. When future reduced-redundancy feature sets are added, they will also get their own set-level call to calculate the particular selection of features at once, as well as being added to the general `catch_all()` function. Over time and with enough additional feature set additions, the `catch_all()` function will likely begin to approximate a respectable portion of the overall functionality of `hctsa` - though this is very much a long-term goal.

An example for a single time series might look like the following:

```{r message = FALSE, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(catchEmAll)
x <- 1 + 0.5 * 1:1000 + arima.sim(list(ma = 0.5), n = 1000)
outs <- catchaMouse16_all(x)
```

### Individual feature calculations

If you do not want to or need to run the entire sets of `catch22_all()` or `catchaMouse16_all()`, you can also access the individual feature calculations as their unique function names, for example `SC_FluctAnal_2_rsrangefit_50_1_logi_prop_r1(x)`.

### Plotting

`catchEmAll` also comes with a built-in plotting engine for visualising output matrices as heatmaps. The function `plot_feature_matrix()` takes the output of any of the above feature calculation functions, and produces a `ggplot` object heatmap showing the feature vectors across the `x` axis and each time series down the `y` axis. Prior to plotting, the function hierarchically clusters the data across both rows and columns to visually highlight the empirical structure. An indicative graphic is presented below.

```{r message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(catchEmAll)

# Read in sample dataset

load("helpers/sample.Rda")

# Render graphic

plot_feature_matrix(trial, is_normalised = FALSE, id_var = "unique_id", method = "MinMax")
```

### Pipeline considerations

As the calculated feature values are likely going to be used for some form of analysis, putting them all on an equal scale is crucial for any statistical or machine learning model. `catchEmAll` includes a convenience function `normalise_catch()` to rescale a vector of values (e.g. vector of values for all participants in a study on the `CO_AddNoise_1_even_10_ami_at_10()` feature) into a variety of different ranges for ease-of-use. These currently include:

* z-score
* Sigmoid
* Outlier-robust Sigmoid (credit to Ben Fulcher for creating the original [MATLAB version](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa))
* Min-max

As an efficient and scalable workflow is front-of-mind, this function has been coded in C++ which makes it compute far faster than the available functions in R (see below for trivial benchmarking example). This function will be expanded into a full automated feature set scaling operation on the output dataframes of the core time-series functions.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(catchEmAll)
x <- seq(from = 1, to = 1000, by = 1)
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(normalise_catch(x, method = "MinMax"), scales::rescale(x, to = c(0,1)), times = 1000)
```

## Available data

A tidy dataframe of all the included features and the set they each correspond to is provided as a `.rda` file which can be viewed easily using the following:

```{r message = FALSE, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(catchEmAll)
View(feature_list)
```

```{r message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(catchEmAll)
knitr::kable(feature_list)
```

## Future directions

Additional time series feature sets will be be added to `catchEmAll`. This may include coding entirely new feature sets, or coding features from existing `R` packages such as [`feasts`](https://feasts.tidyverts.org) and [`tsfeatures`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tsfeatures/vignettes/tsfeatures.html) in `C` or `C++` for computational efficiency and ease-of-comparison on feature-space tasks such as classification and regression.
