Description: Implementation of CAnonical Time-series CHaracteristics (catch22),
    CAnonical Time-series Characteristics for Mouse fMRI (catchaMouse16), and other 
    characteristics sets in R. Calculates summary statistics for select reduced-redundancy 
    time-series features on input vectors to enable pattern detection, classification, and regression 
    applications in the computationally-efficient feature space. Feature calculations 
    are coded in C and C++ for computational efficiency.
