Description: Implementation of CAnonical Time-series CHaracteristics (catch22),
    CAnonical Time-series Characteristics for Mouse fMRI (catchaMouse16), and other 
    characteristics sets in R. Calculates reduced-redundancy time-series features statistics
    on input vectors to enable pattern detection, classification, and regression 
    applications in the computationally-efficient feature space compared to the
    measurement space. Feature calculations are coded in C for computational efficiency.
