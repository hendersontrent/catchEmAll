Description: Implementation of CAnonical Time-series CHaracteristics feature sets in R.
    Includes previously developed sets such as catch22 and CAnonical Time-series 
    Characteristics for Mouse fMRI (catchaMouse16). Calculates summary statistics for 
    select reduced-redundancy time-series features on input vectors to enable pattern 
    detection, similarity, classification, and regression applications in the 
    computationally-efficient feature space. Feature calculations are coded in C and 
    C++ for computational efficiency.
