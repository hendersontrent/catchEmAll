Description: Implementation of the CAnonical Time-series CHaracteristics (catch22) and
    CAnonical Time-series Characteristics for Mouse fMRI in R. Calculates reduced-redundancy
    time-series features on input data. Feature calculations are coded in C for computational
    efficiency. Future reduced feature sets will likely also be added, and will be coded in
    either C or C++ for this purpose.
