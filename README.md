Calculation and visualisation of CAnonical Time-series CHaracteristics
for multiple domains - an efficient implementation for `R` written as a
package to calculate, process, and visualise time-series features from
[catch22](https://github.com/chlubba/catch22),
[catchaMouse16](https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/catchaMouse16),
and other reduced-redundancy feature sets.

## Installation

Currently, installation of `catchEmAll` requires a working installation
of [GNU Scientific Library (GSL)](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).
GSL is a library of scientific and statistical functions for C and C++
programmers. Please download and install this before installing
`catchEmAll`. This dependency may be rectified in the near future.

*Coming to CRAN soon… Stay posted\!*

You can install the development version of `catchEmAll` from GitHub
using the following:

``` r
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/catchEmAll")
```

## Wiki

Please visit the detailed [`catchEmAll`
Wiki](https://github.com/hendersontrent/catchEmAll/wiki) for extensive
information on available functions, motivation behind the package, and
other key things to understand.

## Hex sticker

The current hex sticker is probably a placeholder - a more professional
one might come soon\!
